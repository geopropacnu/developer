Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair is widely regarded as one of Tarantino's best films and one of the greatest action films of all time. It has received critical acclaim and numerous awards and nominations. It has also influenced many other filmmakers and media, such as the video game No More Heroes and the anime Afro Samurai.

Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair is divided into ten chapters, each with a different title and style. The film follows a non-linear narrative, jumping back and forth in time and location. The film begins with The Bride being shot in the head by Bill at her wedding rehearsal in Texas. She survives the attack and wakes up from a coma four years later. She then begins her quest for vengeance, crossing off the names of her former comrades from a list.
 
The Bride travels to Japan, where she confronts O-Ren Ishii, the leader of the Tokyo underworld and the Crazy 88 gang. She also faces O-Ren's bodyguard, Gogo Yubari, a sadistic schoolgirl with a meteor hammer. The Bride kills O-Ren in a sword duel in a snow-covered garden. She then returns to the US, where she battles Vernita Green, a suburban housewife and mother. The Bride kills Vernita with a knife in front of her daughter.
 
The Bride then goes to Mexico, where she meets Esteban Vihaio, an old friend of Bill and a pimp. He tells her where to find Bill and his brother, Budd, who is now a bouncer at a strip club. The Bride ambushes Budd at his trailer, but he shoots her with a shotgun loaded with rock salt and buries her alive. However, The Bride escapes from the grave using a technique taught by her former master, Pai Mei. She then confronts Budd at his trailer again, only to find him dead from a black mamba snake bite planted by Elle Driver, another former colleague and rival.
