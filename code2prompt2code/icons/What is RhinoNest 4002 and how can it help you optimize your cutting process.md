# What is RhinoNest 4002 and how can it help you optimize your cutting process?
 
RhinoNest 4002 is a plug-in for Rhinoceros, a 3D modeling software that allows you to create, edit, analyze, and translate curves, surfaces, solids, meshes, and point clouds. RhinoNest 4002 is a solution for optimizing the cutting, position, and orientation of parts on sheets of material, preparing the model for cutting on CNC machines. This application allows you to save materials by placing the pieces of the laid-out 3D objects as close as possible on the sheet.

RhinoNest 4002 has many features that make it easy and efficient to use, such as:
 
- Supporting any type of geometry, including surface, solids, and meshes.
- Auto-detecting duplicates, texts, and curves.
- Defining multiple panels with different sizes, materials, quantities, and SKUs.
- Using real or rectangular shapes for optimization.
- Setting priorities and order of placement for objects.
- Using free rotation or fixed angles for orientation.
- Displaying a list of panels with number of items, used area, and free area.
- Exporting reports in text format or copying values to clipboard.
- Integrating with Grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor for Rhino.
- Slicing 3D objects for laminating or cutting.

RhinoNest 4002 is ideal for different areas of production that require material cut, such as carpentry, furniture, sheet metal, footwear, glass cut, marine, banners, modeling etc. It is a highly effective position optimization tool that contributes to important efficient material saving without reducing the ease of use. It allows you to optimize in minutes without the need of exporting and importing into another software. RhinoNest 4002 is fully integrated and designed for Rhino and therefore provides optimization in minutes without the need to import files from other software[^1^] [^2^].

How to use RhinoNest 4002 for your cutting process?
 
Using RhinoNest 4002 for your cutting process is simple and intuitive. You just need to follow these steps:

1. Install RhinoNest 4002 as a plug-in for Rhinoceros. You can download it from the developer's site or use the demo version.
2. Open Rhinoceros and create or import your 3D model. You can use any type of geometry, such as surface, solids, or meshes.
3. Select the objects that you want to optimize and click on the RhinoNest icon on the toolbar. This will open the RhinoNest dialog box.
4. Define the panels that you want to use for cutting. You can specify the size, material, quantity, and SKU of each panel. You can also use real or rectangular shapes for optimization.
5. Set the options for optimization, such as space between parts, distance from panel edges, maximum optimization time, rotation angle, etc.
6. Click on the Nest button to start the optimization process. RhinoNest will calculate the best position and orientation for each part on the panels and display the results in a 3D view.
7. Review the results and make any adjustments if needed. You can move, rotate, or delete parts manually. You can also use the Slice command to slice 3D objects for laminating or cutting.
8. Generate a report with the information about the panels, such as number of items, used area, and free area. You can export the report in text format or copy it to clipboard.
9. Save or export your optimized model for cutting on CNC machines. You can use different formats, such as DXF, DWG, AI, PDF, etc.

That's it! You have successfully used RhinoNest 4002 for your cutting process. You can now enjoy the benefits of saving materials and time with this powerful plug-in.
