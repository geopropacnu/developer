The movie Remo has a simple and familiar story of a boy-meets-girl scenario. Sivakarthikeyan plays Siva, a struggling actor who auditions for a role in director K. S. Ravikumar's film. He fails to impress the director with his acting skills, but catches a glimpse of Kavya, a doctor who works in the same hospital where the audition takes place. He falls in love with her at first sight and decides to pursue her.
 
However, he faces two obstacles: Kavya is already engaged to a rich businessman named Vishwa, and she does not like actors. Siva learns that Kavya is looking for a nurse to take care of her grandfather, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. He sees this as an opportunity to get close to her and decides to disguise himself as a female nurse named Remo.
 
Remo manages to get hired by Kavya and wins the affection of her grandfather and family. He also tries to impress Kavya with his charm and wit, while sabotaging Vishwa's attempts to woo her. He hopes that Kavya will eventually fall in love with him and break off her engagement. However, things get complicated when Kavya discovers Remo's true identity and feels betrayed by his lies.
 
Will Remo be able to convince Kavya that he loves her sincerely? Will Kavya forgive Remo for his deception and choose him over Vishwa? Will Remo achieve his dream of becoming an actor? These are some of the questions that the movie tries to answer in a humorous and romantic way.
